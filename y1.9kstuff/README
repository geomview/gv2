This directory contains a bunch of stuff --- notes and code --- from
work that I and Lori Thomson and John MacDonald did at the Geometry
Center on a C++ version of Geomview around 1997-98 (it was all in
years 19xx rather than 20xx, hence the directory name "y1.9k..").

The code here is not currently used in Geomview 2.0 but I'm keeping
it around for a while in case it proves useful later.

Many of the notes in the various *.NOTES files don't apply
to the current 2.0 version, but some do.  I'll sort this
out and make sense of it later.
