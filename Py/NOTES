design world/camera graph structure


work out transformations for old GV style mouse motions:
	target, center, frame, etc.


design motion object & motion list

implement motion with timer & tock() function

inertia:
    if coords of mouse-up differ from coords of last move,
    impart some inertia

maybe: when a (inertia?) motion event occurs just
	create a motion in a list of motions maintained
	for the current world.  Upon redraw, apply
	all the motions, possibly taking elapsed or
	current time into account, then actually redraw.




more parsing: LIST, INST, VECT, perhaps MESH
